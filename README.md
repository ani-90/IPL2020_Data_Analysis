# IPL2020_Data_Analysis

The aim of this project is to visually represent the IPL data. Visual display of data is essential since pictures are more appealing to the audience than plain text.
Python provides an amazing module known as Matplotlib which is used for data visualization.

In this project I have used the IPL Data which is available in the official website (iplt20.com). I have used sqlite3, which is a built-in module in Python to store the data in the database. The data present is queried and stored into Numpy arrays and Matplotlib is used to visually represent the data.
